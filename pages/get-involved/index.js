            <h2>Why support Ace Centre?</h2>
            <p>
              Staffed by teams of teachers, therapists and technicians, Ace
              Centre offers many years experience and expertise in Assistive
              Technology (AT), particularly Augmentative and Alternative
              Communication (AAC). The charity also provides a range of general
              services to support children and adults with severe communication
              difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are grateful to sponsors, commissioners and funding bodies that
              enable us to continue and develop our provision. As a relatively
              small charity we depend on regular giving to be able to continue
              to offer high quality services that are effective for those who
              use them.
            </p>
            <p>
              By supporting Ace Centre you help ensure that people with the
              severest communication challenges continue to benefit from
              professional assessment and intervention. Whilst we often make use
              of low-tech gadgets and techniques we also need to be able to
              provide expensive solutions for those who need them.
            </p>
            <p>This is why we hope you will support Ace Centre.</p>
