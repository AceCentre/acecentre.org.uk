The content below WILL NOT be rendered to the users

export const meta = {
  title: "Product documentation",
  subtitle: "How to use X80",
};

import MarkdownLayout from "../../../components/markdown-layout";
import { withGlobalProps } from "../../../lib/global-props/inject";

export default ({ children }) => (
  <MarkdownLayout {...meta}>{children}</MarkdownLayout>
);
