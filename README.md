### Setup

Before getting started make sure that you have the following installed:

- Node (LTS)
- Yarn (`npm i -g yarn`)

Make sure to install the dependencies using `yarn install`

### Running in Dev Mode

You can run the NextJS app by doing `yarn dev`. You can then see the website at localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Graphql

The website is powered by Wordpress but uses [WPGraphql](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) to expose an API from wordpress. You can explore the API at our hosted graphql playground at [acecentreorguk.netlify.app/api/graphql](https://acecentreorguk.netlify.app/api/graphql)
