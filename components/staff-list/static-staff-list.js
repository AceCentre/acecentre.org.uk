      "<p>I am a speech and language therapist, completing my qualification at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. During the degree I became very interested in AAC, choosing to complete my honours project with an AAC focus. After completing the degree and spending six months as a research assistant, I moved to the UK to complete a Master of Science in AAC at the University of Dundee. This gave me a greater understanding of AAC, especially from an academic and computing perspective and further fostered my enthusiasm for the design and implementation of AAC.<br />\nAfter graduating I took a post at a charity delivering therapy in a multidisciplinary team to children with complex needs. I am thrilled to have now had the opportunity to join the Ace Centre team where I hope to extend my AAC knowledge further.</p>\n",

It was here I first learned about AAC and decided I wanted to train as a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT). I then got a job as an SLT Assistant for The University of Manchester. This involved working with children in mainstream schools around the North West.</p>\n<p>After returning to University, I qualified as an SLT. I then spent 5 years working at a Specialist College for Adults with Learning Disabilities in Manchester and during this time my interest in AAC grew into a passion.</p>\n<p>I think with all forms of AAC the key is about making it fun and getting the communication partners on board too. At Ace Centre I enjoy learning new things (on a daily basis) and love to share information with others.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite parts of the job is meeting clients and their families and carers. I enjoy learning about people’s interests and motivations and working to find ways they can say what they want to say, when they want to say it.</p>\n",

      "<p>Let me start by saying that I am from Huddersfield, so a Yorkshire man through and through. My background would not normally be associated with AAC. I worked in Industrial and Operations Management for several well-known multinational companies at senior management and board level. In these roles I have been responsible for consumer goods businesses making and developing products ranging from toiletries, pharmaceuticals, footwear, toothbrushes, razors and wine. In these roles I have worked in the UK and overseas, Including the US, Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel and France.</p>\n<p>I went to the University of Huddersfield and, along with several professional qualifications in Business Management, I have a both a Business Studies degree and a Master’s in Business Administration. In addition, I have also been a Senior Fellow at Cambridge University working on business and process improvement studies.</p>\n<p>So, as you can see, not obviously AAC related. However I first came into contact with Ace Centre back in 1998. At this time, Ace were helping my disabled daughter to develop her communication and technology skills. As a parent of a disabled child, I am very aware of the types of challenges that parents face, and it is this overall background that I bring to the Ace Centre.</p>\n<p>I  joined the Ace Centre  in Autumn 2014 as part of the team when the Ace Centre was selected to deliver the NHS contract. My function is to ensure that the management of the IT, referrals, administration and equipment supports our client’s needs and meets our service commitment to the NHS.</p>\n<p>Outside of the Ace Centre, my interests are anything to do with food and cooking as well as an interest in vehicles and motor sport  (including once building a kit car because it seemed like a good idea at the time!).</p>\n",

      "<p>I began working as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2000 working with children and young people with complex physical and communication difficulties in mainstream and special schools.  Having the opportunity to explore a range of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems and observing how these empowered and enabled these individuals and their families to achieve their potential developed my passion in this area. This led to working as part of a multidisciplinary team with these individuals and a key role in developing a local service for communication aids.</p>\n<p>Following the exciting opportunity to join the Ace Centre team in 2010, I have continued to develop my knowledge and enthusiasm working with children and adults, their families and local services to find innovative and bespoke solutions for communication.  As part of my role, I am also involved in projects, conferences and enjoy the opportunity that this role gives to exploring the latest assistive technology to support those we work with.</p>\n",

      "<p>I am a teacher who loves to learn. I initially trained in primary education, specialising in Modern Foreign Languages. I taught in the Special Education Sector for seven years before becoming an advisory teacher. My interest in AAC and AT led me to move to Ace Centre in 2015. Initially joining Ace Centre as part of the training and assessment team, I discovered my previous skills in design and manufacture of stained glass windows and the joy of cave exploration provided a foundation for engineering. I enjoy finding solutions to mounting communication devices and ways to improve access.</p>\n",
