        As a charity, Ace Centre is always concerned to maintain income through
        multiple sources including commissions, grants and donations. A contract
        with NHS England funds the delivery of specialised AAC services across
        the North West and Thames Valley and Wessex NHS regions. Direct work
        with people who fall outside of the NHS contract criteria, as well as
        other services such as research and development, training, and advocacy,
        depend on voluntary contributions.
