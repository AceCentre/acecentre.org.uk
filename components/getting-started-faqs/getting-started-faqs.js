    question: "Won’t using AAC hold back speech development?",
    answer: `
        <p>
          This is a really common anxiety. However, all the research suggests
          that far from holding speech back, using AAC can even encourage it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when
          <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/acecentre/article/13924559">
            Diane Millar, Janice Light and Ralph Schlosser
          </a>
          analysed the literature in 2006, they found that following the
          introduction of AAC, no cases demonstrated a decrease in speech
          production, some showed no change, and most demonstrated gains in
          speech production.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some, use of AAC will be part of their journey towards speech.
          Whilst speech is developing, it can underpin the development of their
          language and communication skills. This means that language isn’t ‘put
          on hold’ until speech comes, resulting in long term deficits or
          delays. For others, use of AAC will be part of their lives forever.
          Either way, putting the work in now will only help someone to be a
          good communicator, however this is done, in the future.

    question:
      "Why do you recommend paper based resources alongside screen based solutions?",
    answer: `
        <p>
          The world of communication aid technology has come on so far in the
          last few years that some people question whether there is still a role
          for low tech (or paper-based) AAC. There is! Paper based resources are
          wonderfully flexible and can be used in so many different contexts.
          They have the great advantage of not requiring batteries, so they are
          always available, and with no screen to smash, they are pretty durable
          too. For some, paper based resources are a great back up to their high
          tech system (for example, when their system runs out of battery or
          when they are somewhere where the high tech system can’t be used –
          like bed or bath), and for others they are their main method of
          communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality most people who use AAC communicate using a range of
          different approaches that includes their own mixture of low tech AAC,
          sounds (or some speech), gesture, signing, drawing, writing and high
          tech AAC. For example, someone might use their eyes to draw your
          attention to the box of cereal they would like you to pass them, make
          a sound to greet a friend, and use their high tech AAC device to have
          a discussion around an issue that is important to them.
          <a href="http://aacbooks.net/books/UsingLowTechSymbolSystemsChildren/#movie1.1-beth">
            Beth explains this beautifully in her video.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Janice Light and David McNaughton are well known researchers in the
          field. They stress that technology in and of itself is not important –
          what’s important is the communication. Technology is just one tool
          among many that can help us to communicate.

    question: "How do I get started with Symbol charts?",
    answer: `
        <p>
          Getting started with low tech AAC is all about finding a way of
          bringing AAC into daily activities that are relevant for you and your
          family.&nbsp; It’s about finding communication opportunities that are
          motivating and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          These charts are one small step on the journey towards developing a
          full communication system based around symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charts are there to be used by you.&nbsp; If the child begins to
          join in, that’s great, but don’t force them to use the symbols.&nbsp;
          They need to become really familiar with the symbols and how to use
          them.&nbsp; That can only happen by you using them yourself as you
          talk to your child.&nbsp; You can see an example of this 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieeREOclfPE&amp;list=PLWWQ5nlUD_ttEtnbmILMp0e35-Dic2JUb&amp;index=2">
            in action here
          </a>
          . You really are the key to getting started with AAC.&nbsp; Your skill
          at pointing to the symbols while talking to and playing with your
          child is what will get AAC going.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example charts are designed to be accessed by pointing to the
          symbols.&nbsp; However, you could cut the symbols out and arrange them
          on an E-tran frame for eye pointing communicators.&nbsp; You can see
          an example of symbols being 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwgD8YZD3k&amp;list=PLWWQ5nlUD_ttEtnbmILMp0e35-Dic2JUb&amp;index=11">
            selected on an E-tran here
          </a>
          . You could also scan through the symbols for those using 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY2D59MpxBw&amp;list=PLWWQ5nlUD_ttEtnbmILMp0e35-Dic2JUb&amp;index=12">
            listener mediated scanning
          </a>
          , although make sure you are consistent in the order in which you
          offer the symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          The communication charts in the 
          <a href="https://acecentre.org.uk/resources/">Resources section</a> 
          are available in three different symbols sets – PCS (Picture
          Communication Symbols), Widgit and Symbolstix. &nbsp;&nbsp;No one
          symbol set is ‘better’ than another, it’s more a case of looking
          around at what symbols (if any) are being used in the child’s
          environment and trying to use the same.&nbsp; Similarly if the child
          is using symbols within a communication app or communication aid, or
          some sort of recording software, it is helpful to choose the same
          symbols if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a set of words that we use across huge numbers of different
          situations – these are known as ‘core’ words.&nbsp; These are words
          like ‘help’, ‘look’, ‘more’, ‘stop’, etc.&nbsp; Some of the charts
          simply contain core vocabulary, which means that you can use them in
          any situation.&nbsp; Other charts have been designed to show how
          charts can support specific activities.&nbsp; However, these charts
          all contain some core vocabulary too.&nbsp; Hopefully at least one of
          the activities will be something that appeals to your child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try and choose a chart that feels a step ahead of where you think your
          child is at.&nbsp; This will enable you to demonstrate the next steps
          as you use the chart.&nbsp; It’s what we do all the time with speaking
          children – we repeat back what they say, adding an extra word.&nbsp;
          We are all natural language teachers!
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WWpdtbwcwA&amp;index=13&amp;list=PLWWQ5nlUD_ttEtnbmILMp0e35-Dic2JUb">
            You can see this in action here.
          </a>
          &nbsp; You can always blank off a few symbols if it feels too much
          and gradually reveal them.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a practical note, if you have access to a laminator, you may want
          to laminate the charts to protect them.&nbsp; If you do this, try and
          use matt laminator pouches as the glossy ones are rather prone to
          reflecting overhead lighting, which can make the symbols difficult to
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’ve all gained confidence in using a few of these example
          charts, the next step will be to begin to put together a communication
          book containing a wide range of core and topic vocabulary.&nbsp; For
          this you will need specialist software, although you may find that
          your child’s speech and language therapist and / or school has this
          and can help.
